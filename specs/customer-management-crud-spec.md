### Constraints

#### Technical Stack and Frameworks
- **Next.js 15+** with App Router for all API routes and server-side functionality
- **React 19** with modern hooks and concurrent features for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4** following existing design system patterns and responsive breakpoints
- **Zod** for comprehensive input validation and schema definition
- **Path aliases** using `@/*` mapping to `./src/*` for consistent imports

#### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Times**: All CRUD operations must complete within 200ms for local mock data
- **Component Rendering**: CustomerCard grid must render 100+ items within 500ms using virtualization if needed
- **Search Performance**: Real-time search results must appear within 100ms of user input
- **Memory Usage**: Client-side data caching must not exceed 10MB for customer data
- **Bundle Size**: Additional customer management code must not increase bundle size by more than 50KB gzipped

#### Design Constraints
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Support for mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) following existing patterns
