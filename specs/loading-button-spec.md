## Feature: LoadingButton Component

### Context
- Interactive button component that displays loading states during async operations
- Used throughout the Customer Intelligence Dashboard for form submissions, data fetching, and user actions
- Provides clear visual feedback to users during waiting periods
- Essential for maintaining good user experience during network operations and processing

### Requirements
- **Functional requirements:**
  - Toggle between normal and loading states based on isLoading prop
  - Disable button interaction during loading state
  - Display loading spinner with customizable loading text
  - Support different button variants (primary, secondary, outline)
  - Handle click events when not in loading state
- **User interface requirements:**
  - Multiple size variants (small, medium, large)
  - Consistent styling with design system
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Loading spinner animation
  - Clear visual distinction between enabled/disabled states
- **Data requirements:**

  - isLoading boolean to control state
  - Optional loadingText string for custom loading message
- **Integration requirements:**

### Constraints
- **Technical stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

- **Design constraints:**
  - Consistent button sizes (small: 32px, medium: 40px, large: 48px height)
  - Loading spinner size matches text size
